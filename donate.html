Approximate annual attendance at the Fall Show is 2,500 – that means that all of these patrons will view your ad, which is excellent coverage for your advertising dollar. At the same time, you will be shown as being supportive of the arts in our community. In appreciation, you will receive ticket vouchers redeemable for two tickets at each evening’s performance during the annual fall show. Our advertising rates are very reasonable with several different sizes and layouts available. Special Support There are many reasons to support CenterStage Band and Show Choir Inc. with a donation. We are a community band and show choir made up of your friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers. CenterStage is a 501(c) (3) non-profit organization, so your gift is tax deductible.</p>
